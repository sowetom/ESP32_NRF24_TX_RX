# ESP32_NRF24_TX_RX
This project was my attempt to build a simple transmitter receiver remote control or joystick with 2 servos on the receive side to control either camera movements robotics or simple toys. I use one ESP32 and NRF for TX and another set for RX. There are 2 sketches included, one for each. With the introduction of the ESPNow communication protocol many are using that instead for wireless communication in the 2.4GHz range but keeping a separate 2.4 channel using the NRF will prove useful later on when the project is taken to the next level to create mesh networked devices using wifi backhaul to provide 2 separate 2.4 channels for more bandwidth and interference mitigation. I tried to find an already existing project like this and i imagine there are but this is my version. I try to use timer based interrupts/delays to sync transmission packets but this only shows the beginnings of that process. I will model the communication protocol based on cellular concepts to minimize losses and increase bandwidth efficiency plus audio/video packets will eventually be sent along with coordinate data.
